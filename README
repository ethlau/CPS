HOW TO USE 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The main program here is:

./Flender_XSB_profile/save_xl.cpp

This enables us to preserve the Fourier components of X-ray emission from individual halos as a function of halo mass and redshift.
To run this code, you need the input parameter file (please see ./Flender_XSB_profile/param_fid for example).
When using the input file of param_fid, you have the output file named xl.dat which contains the Fourier components of X-ray emission.

Similarly, you need to preserve the Fourier components of compoton y in advance with:

./Flender_pressure_profile/save_yl.cpp

Then, you can move to the computation of power spectra among lensing, Compton-y map and X-ray surface brightness with

./cross_power/halo_model.C.

To run this code, you need the output files from ./Flender_XSB_profile/save_xl.cpp and ./Flender_pressure_profile/save_yl.cpp as mentioned in above.
Also, you have to tell the input cosmological paramaters (Omega_m0, w_DE, and H_0) and corresponding linear matter power spectrum,
i.e.

cd cross_corr
./halo_model test.cl ../Flender_XSB_profile/xl.dat ../Flender_pressure_profile/yl.dat ../input_pk/wmap9_fid_matterpower_z0.dat 0.279 -1 0.70 0 z_source

where z_source is the source redshift in lening. Then you have the output file of test.cl showing the angular power spectrum of X-ray surface brightness.

For fiducial case, I assume the WMAP9 cosmological paramaters for a flat LCDM model:

- H0 = 70.0 km/s/Mpc
- Omega_m0 = 0.2790
- Omega_b0 = 0.0461 
- w_DE     = -1.000
- Omega_K  = 0.0000 
- n_s      = 0.9720

and the linear matter power spectrum is obtained from CAMB.

If you want to change cosmological model, you have to modify the input file for ./Flender_XSB_profile/save_xl.cpp and  ./Flender_pressure_profile/save_yl.cpp
and reset the Fourier components of X-ray emission and compton y.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
